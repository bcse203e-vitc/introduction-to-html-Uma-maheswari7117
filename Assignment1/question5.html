            One book I really enjoyed is <u>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</u> by <u>J.K. Rowling</u>. 
            It tells the story of a <b><i>young</i></b> wizard who discovers his <b><i>magical</i></b> heritage and attends a <b><i>mysterious</i></b> school called Hogwarts. 
            The book is full of <b><i>exciting</i></b> adventures, <b><i>strange</i></b> creatures, and <b><i>powerful</i></b> friendships that make it truly <b><i>unforgettable</i></b>.
